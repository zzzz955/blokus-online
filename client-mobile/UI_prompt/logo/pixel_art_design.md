Bloblo Game Logo - Pixel Art Design Prompts (Space Theme)
================================================================================

Create vibrant pixel art logos for "Bloblo" - a colorful block-placement puzzle game with cosmic space aesthetic.

================================================================================
VERSION 1: WIDE BANNER LOGO (600x150)
================================================================================

**Purpose**: Header banners, wide UI elements, landscape orientations

Create a wide horizontal pixel art logo for "Bloblo" with a cosmic space theme. The logo should feature bold, chunky pixel art text "Bloblo" (capital B, lowercase rest) as the main focal point, centered in the composition. Surround the text with vibrant geometric blocks floating in space - use 3-5 colorful tetromino-style blocks in neon colors (blue #3061ff, green #30ff30, yellow #fffc30, red #ff3030). Add a space theme backdrop with subtle cosmic elements: tiny pixel stars scattered around, small glowing particles, gentle nebula wisps in purple/pink tones, or distant planets. The blocks should appear to be floating in zero gravity around the text. Use clean 16-bit to 32-bit pixel art style with sharp, crisp pixels and NO anti-aliasing. The text should be white or bright yellow with a subtle pixel outline or glow effect for prominence. Include subtle shading on blocks for 3D depth with highlights and shadows. The composition should feel energetic and playful while maintaining the vast, mysterious feel of space. The logo should have sufficient negative space and not feel cluttered - space should provide breathing room. Only the outer edges should be transparent (PNG format). The overall mood should be fun, inviting, cosmic, and adventurous.

**Dimensions**: 600x150 pixels (4:1 aspect ratio - very wide)
**Format**: PNG with transparent background
**Style**: Pixel art with cosmic space theme
**Text**: "Bloblo" - bold, prominent, centered
**Colors**: Neon blocks + space elements (stars, nebula, cosmic dust)
**Key Features**:
- Extra wide format perfect for headers and banners
- Space elements subtle and atmospheric
- Blocks floating in zero gravity arrangement
- Text takes up central 60-70% of width
- Cosmic background creates depth without overwhelming

================================================================================
VERSION 2: STANDARD HORIZONTAL LOGO (512x256)
================================================================================

**Purpose**: App icons, square/near-square layouts, general branding

Create a horizontal pixel art logo for "Bloblo" with a vibrant cosmic space theme. The logo should feature bold, chunky pixel art text "Bloblo" (capital B, lowercase rest) as the dominant central element. Surround the text with colorful geometric blocks (3-5 tetromino-style pieces) in bright neon colors (blue #3061ff, green #30ff30, yellow #fffc30, red #ff3030) that appear to float in space. Integrate space-themed elements: scattered pixel stars of varying sizes creating depth, small glowing cosmic particles, gentle purple and pink nebula wisps in the background, tiny distant planets or asteroids. The blocks should have subtle 3D shading with highlights on top-left and shadows on bottom-right for depth. The text should be white or bright yellow with a prominent pixel outline or subtle glow effect. Add small sparkle pixels around text and blocks for a cosmic shimmer effect. Use clean 16-bit to 32-bit retro pixel art style with sharp, visible pixels and NO blur or anti-aliasing. The space background should be subtle and atmospheric - creating mood without competing with the text. Arrange blocks playfully around the text edges - some partially behind, some in front, creating visual interest and depth. The overall feel should be energetic, playful, cosmic, and adventurous with a modern retro game aesthetic. Transparent background (PNG). Balance is key - "Bloblo" text must remain the star while space and blocks provide context and personality.

**Dimensions**: 512x256 pixels (2:1 aspect ratio)
**Format**: PNG with transparent background
**Style**: Pixel art with vibrant space theme
**Text**: "Bloblo" - bold, centered, most prominent element
**Colors**: Neon blocks + cosmic space (stars, nebula, particles)
**Key Features**:
- Balanced horizontal composition
- Space theme adds atmosphere and depth
- Blocks arranged dynamically (some behind, some in front of text)
- Cosmic shimmer effects (small sparkles, glows)
- Text remains primary focus with 50-60% visual weight

CREATIVE DIRECTION NOTES
================================================================================

**For AI Image Generators**:
- Emphasize "pixel art" style multiple times
- Specify "NO anti-aliasing, NO blur, sharp pixels"
- Clearly state "Bloblo text is the main focus"
- Describe space elements as "subtle, atmospheric, NOT overpowering"
- Request "transparent background, PNG format"
- Mention "16-bit or 32-bit retro gaming aesthetic"

**Composition Tips**:
- Text should occupy 50-60% of visual attention
- Blocks frame the text (left, right, top, bottom edges)
- Space elements fill negative space with atmosphere
- Use depth: foreground blocks, midground text, background space
- Maintain breathing room - don't fill every pixel

**Color Strategy**:
- Blocks: Use full vibrant neon colors
- Text: Bright white or yellow for maximum contrast
- Space: Use softer, darker purple/pink tones for contrast
- Stars: Small white pixels scattered throughout
- Balance warm (red, yellow) and cool (blue, green, purple) colors
